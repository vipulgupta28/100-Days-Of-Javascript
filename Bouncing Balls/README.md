## Bouncing Balls Animation
## Overview
The Bouncing Balls Animation is a fun and interactive project that uses the HTML <canvas> element and JavaScript to simulate colorful balls bouncing around the screen. The balls randomly move, change directions when they hit the edges, and create a visually appealing effect.

## Features
Dynamic Animation: Balls move and bounce in random directions.
Random Colors: Each ball is assigned a unique, random color.
Responsive Design: The animation automatically adjusts to the screen size, even when the browser window is resized.
Smooth Motion: The balls have a smooth and continuous movement thanks to JavaScript's requestAnimationFrame.
## Demo
To see the animation in action:

Open the project in any modern web browser.
Watch colorful balls bounce around the screen!
Project Structure
HTML: Sets up the canvas for rendering the animation.
CSS: Ensures the canvas covers the entire screen and provides a clean background.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for ball movement, collision detection, and rendering.
