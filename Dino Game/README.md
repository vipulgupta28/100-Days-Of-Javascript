## Google Dino T-REX Game

This is a simple implementation of the **Google Dino T-REX Game** which can be played directly in the browser. The game features a dinosaur (T-REX) that must jump over incoming obstacles (cacti) to avoid collisions and continue running. The score increases as the game progresses, and the game ends if the dinosaur collides with an obstacle.

## Features

- **Dino Jumping**: The dinosaur can jump using the `Space` or `Arrow Up` key.
- **Cactus Obstacles**: Cacti appear randomly and move toward the dinosaur.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded for every second the game is active, and the score is displayed on the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: If the dinosaur collides with an obstacle, the game ends, and the final score is shown.
- **Sound Effects**: Jump sound effect is triggered when the dinosaur jumps.

## Game Controls

- **Jump**: Press the `Spacebar` or `Arrow Up` to make the dinosaur jump.
