# Day 2  
## Snake Game  

### Description  
In this project, I have coded a classic **Snake Game** using **JavaScript**. The user controls the snake using arrow keys, and the game tracks the score each time the snake eats the food.  

### Features  
- **Arrow Key Controls**: Use the keyboard arrow keys to move the snake in different directions.  
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases every time the snake eats the food.  
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows as it eats, making the game progressively more challenging.
